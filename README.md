Learning: Growing personal knowledge graph
"Embrace the suffering of growth"

- Generation

  - Extract broad knowledge graph from text
  - Extend with spontaneous entities/relations

- Evaluation

  - Explain contents of knowledge graph, eliminating uncertanties
  - Apply knowledge graph, evaluating with active feedback

- Internalization

  - Retain knowledge graph with active recall and mnemonics
  - Exercise/organize/rest when focus dips. 90 minute cycles.

- Partially automating this learning process to make learning faster.

## Getting Started
